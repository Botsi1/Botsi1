# 💫 About Me:
I am a full stack developer with knowledge in programming languages like javascript, python, libraries like react and redux.<br>I am a very curious person, passionate about science and technology, eager to continue learning the branch of programming. When it comes to working in a team I adapt, I am a social and sincere person.<br>I studied at the SoyHenry bootcamp where I did two projects that taught me a lot about programming: the first one was individual where I had to build a SPA (Single Page Application) where the application shows a list of videogames and you can create a videogame through a form.<br>The second project was a group project and consisted of a real estate website where you can buy and rent properties by paying a part of the value of the property through the website and then you contact the seller. In this project that I did with my colleagues I was in charge of the back-end and front-end.<br><br>
